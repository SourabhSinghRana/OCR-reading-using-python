between SARS-CoV-2 and different strains of
SARS-CoV and SARS-like (SL) CoVs to evaluate
the possibility of repurposed vaccines against
COVID-19. This strategy will be helpful in the
scenario of an outbreak, since much time can be

saved, because preliminary evaluation, including in
vitro studies, already would be completed for such
vaccine candidates.

Multiepitope subunit vaccines can be considered
a promising preventive strategy against the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic. Jn silico and advanced
immunoinformatic tools can be used to develop
multiepitope subunit vaccines. The vaccines that are
engineered by this technique can be further evaluated
using docking studies and, if found effective, then
can be further evaluated in animal models (365).
Identifying epitopes that have the potential to
become a vaccine candidate is critical to developing
an effective vaccine against COVID-19. The
immunoinformatics approach has been used for
recognizing essential epitopes of cytotoxic T
lymphocytes and B_ cells from the surface
glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Recently, a few
epitopes have been recognized from the SARS-CoV-
2 surface glycoprotein. The selected epitopes

explored targeting molecular dynamic simulations,
