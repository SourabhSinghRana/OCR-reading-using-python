twice in a volume of 200 to 250ml on the day of

collection (310). At present, treatment for sepsis and
ARDS mainly involves antimicrobial therapy, source
control, and supportive care. Hence, the use of
therapeutic plasma exchange can be considered an
option in managing such severe conditions. Further
randomized trials can be designed to investigate its
efficacy (311).

Potential Therapeutic Agents

Potent therapeutics to combat SARS-CoV-2
infection include virus binding molecules, molecules
or inhibitors targeting particular enzymes implicated
in replication and transcription process of the virus,
helicase inhibitors, vital viral proteases and proteins,
protease inhibitors of host cells, endocytosis
inhibitors, short interfering RNA _ (siRNA),
neutralizing antibodies, MAbs against the host
receptor, MAbs interfering with the Sl RBD,
antiviral peptide aimed at S2, and _ natural
drugs/medicines (7, ; ). The S protein acts as
the critical target for developing CoV antivirals, like
inhibitors of S protein and S cleavage, neutralizing
antibodies, RBD-ACE2 blockers, siRNAs, blockers
of the fusion core, and proteases (168).

All of these therapeutic approaches have revealed
