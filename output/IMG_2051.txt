hDPP4) for MERS-CoV infection (221). The
CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing tool has been used for
inserting genomic alterations in mice, making them
susceptible to MERS-CoV infection (222). Efforts
are under way to recognize suitable animal models
for SARS-CoV2/COVID-19, identify the receptor
affinity of this virus, study pathology in experimental

animal models, and explore virus-specific immune
responses and protection studies, which together
would increase the pace of efforts being made for
developing potent vaccines and drugs to counter this
emerging virus. Cell lines, such as monkey epithelial
cell lines (LLC-MK2 and Vero-B4), goat lung cells,
alpaca kidney cells, dromedary umbilical cord cells,
and advanced ex _ vivo _ three-dimensional
tracheobronchial tissue, have been explored to study
human CoVs (MERS-CoV) (223, ). Vero and
Huh-7 cells (human liver cancer cells) have been
used for isolating SARS-CoV-2 (194).

Recently, an experimental study with rhesus
monkeys as animal models revealed the absence of
any viral loads in nasopharyngeal and anal swabs,
and no viral replication was recorded in the primary
tissues at a time interval of 5 days post-reinfection in
reexposed monkeys (274). The — subsequent
