mutations that occur during subsequent human-to-

human transmission is warranted.

M Protein

The M protein is the most abundant viral protein
present in the virion particle, giving a definite shape
to the viral envelope (48). It binds to the
nucleocapsid and acts as a central organizer of
coronavirus assembly (49). Coronavirus M proteins
are highly diverse in amino acid contents but
maintain overall structural similarity within different
genera (50). The M protein has three transmembrane
domains, flanked by a short amino terminus outside
the virion and a long carboxy terminus inside the
virion (50). Overall, the viral scaffold is maintained
by M-M interaction. Of note, the M protein of
SARS-CoV-2. does not have an amino acid
substitution compared to that of SARS-CoV (16).

E Protein

The coronavirus E protein is the most enigmatic
and smallest of the major structural proteins (51). It
plays a multifunctional role in the pathogenesis,
assembly, and release of the virus (52). It is a small
integral membrane polypeptide that acts as a

viroporin (ion channel) (53). The inactivation or
