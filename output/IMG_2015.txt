there has been concern regarding the Impact ol
SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 on pregnancy. Researchers
have mentioned the probability of in utero
transmission of novel SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-
19-infected mothers to their neonates in China based

upon the rise in IgM and IgG antibody levels and
cytokine values in the blood obtained from newborn
infants immediately postbirth; however, RT-PCR
failed to confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2
genetic material in the infants (283). Recent studies
show that at least in some cases, preterm delivery
and its consequences are associated with the virus.
Nonetheless, some cases have raised doubts for the
likelihood of vertical transmission ( ).
COVID-19 infection was associated with
pneumonia, and some developed acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS). The blood biochemistry
indexes, such as albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, C-
reactive protein, lymphocytes (percent), and
neutrophils (percent) give an idea about the disease
severity in COVID-19 infection (121). During
COVID-19, patients may present leukocytosis,
leukopenia with lymphopenia (244),
hypoalbuminemia, and an increase of lactate
dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase, alanine

aminotransferase, bilirubin, and, especially, D-dimer
