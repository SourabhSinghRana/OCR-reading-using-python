13 CONVALESCENT PLASMA
THERAPY

Guo Yanhong, an official with the National
Health Commission (NHC), stated that
convalescent plasma therapy is a significant
method for treating severe COVID-19 patients.
Among the COVID-19 patients currently
receiving convalescent plasma therapy in the
virus-hit Wuhan, one has been discharged from
hospital, as reported by Chinese science
authorities on Monday, 17th February 2020 in
Beijing. The first dose of convalescent plasma
from a COVID-19 patient was collected on 1st
and 9th February 2020 from a severely ill
patient who was given treatment at a hospital in
Jiangxia District in Wuhan. The presence of the
virus in patients is minimised by the antibodies
in the convalescent plasma. Guiqiang stated
that donating plasma may cause minimal harm
to the donor and that there is nothing to be
worried about. Plasma donors must be cured
patients and discharged from hospital. Only
plasma is used, whereas red blood cells (RBC),
white blood cells (WBC) and blood platelets are
transfused back into the donor's body. Wang
alleged that donor's plasma will totally improve
to its initial state after one or 2 weeks from the
day of plasma donation of around 200 to 300
