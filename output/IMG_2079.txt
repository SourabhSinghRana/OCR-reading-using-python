both in vitro and in vivo anti-CoV_ potential.

Although in vitro research carried out with these
therapeutics showed efficacy, most need appropriate
support from randomized animal or human trials.
Therefore, they might be of limited applicability and
require trials against SARS-CoV-2 to gain practical
usefulness. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2
leads to the exacerbation of pneumonia as a
consequence of the imbalance in the renin-
angiotensin system (RAS). The virus-induced
pulmonary inflammatory responses may be reduced
by the administration of ACE inhibitors (ACEI) and
angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT1R) (207).

Several investigations have suggested the use of
small-molecule inhibitors for the potential control of
SARS-CoV infections. Drugs of the FDA-approved
compound library were screened to identify four
small-molecule inhibitors of | MERS-CoV
(chlorpromazine, chloroquine, loperamide, and
lopinavir) that inhibited viral replication. These
compounds also hinder SARS-CoV and human
CoVs (208). Therapeutic strategies involving the use
of specific antibodies or compounds that neutralize
cytokines and their receptors will help to restrain the
host inflammatory responses. Such drugs acting

specifically in the respiratory tract will help to
