confer any noticeable protection, with the absence of

detectable serum SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies
(170). Antigenic determinant sites present over S and
N structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 can be
explored as suitable vaccine candidates (294). In the
Asian population, S, E, M, and N proteins of SARS-
CoV-2 are being targeted for developing subunit
vaccines against COVID-19 (295).

The identification of the immunodominant region
among the subunits and domains of S protein is
critical for developing an effective vaccine against
the coronavirus. The C-terminal domain of the S1
subunit is considered the immunodominant region of
the porcine deltacoronavirus S protein (171).
Similarly, further investigations are needed to
determine the immunodominant regions of SARS-
CoV-2 for facilitating vaccine development.

However, our previous attempts to develop a
universal vaccine that is effective for both SARS-
CoV and MERS-CoV based on T-cell epitope
similarity pointed out the possibility of cross-
reactivity among coronaviruses (172). That can be

made possible by selected potential vaccine targets
that are common to both viruses. SARS-CoV-2 has
been reported to be closely related to SARS-CoV
(173, ). Hence, knowledge and understanding of
