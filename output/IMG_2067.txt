handling of bats for trading purposes poses a
considerable risk of transmitting zoonotic CoV
epidemics (139).

Due to the possible role played by farm and wild
animals in SARS-CoV-2 infection, the WHO, in
their novel coronavirus (COVID-19) situation report,
recommended the avoidance of unprotected contact
with both farm and wild animals (25). The live-
animal markets, like the one in Guangdong, China,
provides a setting for animal coronaviruses to
amplify and to be transmitted to new hosts, like
humans (78). Such markets can be considered a
critical place for the origin of novel zoonotic
diseases and have enormous public health
significance in the event of an outbreak. Bats are the
reservoirs for several viruses; hence, the role of bats
in the present outbreak cannot be ruled out (140). In
a qualitative study conducted for evaluating the
zoonotic risk factors among rural communities of
southern China, the frequent human-animal
interactions along with the low levels’ of
environmental biosecurity were identified as
significant risks for the emergence of zoonotic
disease in local communities (141, ).
