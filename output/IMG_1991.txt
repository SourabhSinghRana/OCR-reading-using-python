CoV lethal challenge. Such antibodies may play a

crucial role in enhancing protective humoral
responses against the emerging CoVs by aiming
appropriate epitopes and functions of the S protein.
The cross-neutralization ability of SARS-CoV RBD-
specific neutralizing MAbs considerably relies on
the resemblance between their RBDs; therefore,
SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies could cross-
neutralized SL CoVs, 1.e., bat-SL-CoV strain WIV1
(RBD with eight amino acid differences from SARS-
CoV) but not bat-SL-CoV strain SHC014 (24 amino
acid differences) (200).

Appropriate RBD-specific MAbs can _ be
recognized by a relative analysis of RBD of SARS-
CoV-2 to that of SARS-CoV, and cross-neutralizing
SARS-CoV RBD-specific MAbs could be explored
for their effectiveness against COVID-19 and further
need to be assessed clinically. The USS.
biotechnology company Regeneron is attempting to
recognize potent and specific MAbs to combat

COVID-19. An ideal therapeutic option suggested
for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is the combination
therapy comprised of MAbs and the drug remdesivir
(COVID-19) (201). The SARS-CoV-specific human
MAb CR3022 is found to bind with SARS-CoV-2
RBD, indicating its potential as a therapeutic agent
