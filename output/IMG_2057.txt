there, there is an increase in the outbreak of
this virus through human-to-human
transmission, with the fact that it has become
widespread around the globe. This confirms the
fact similar to the previous epidemics, including
SARS and MERS, that this coronavirus exhibited
potential human-to-human transmission, as it
was recently declared a pandemic by WHO.7°

Respiratory droplets are the major carrier for
coronavirus transmission. Such droplets can
either stay in the nose or mouth or enter the
lungs via the inhaled air. Currently, it is known
that COVID-19’s transmission from one person
to another also occurs through touching either
an infected surface or even an object. With the
current scant awareness of the transmission
systems however, airborne safety measures
with a high-risk procedure have been proposed
in many countries. Transmission levels, or the
rates from one person to another, reported
differ by both location and interaction with
involvement in infection control. It is stated that
even asymptomatic individuals or those
individuals in their incubation period can act as
carrier of SARS-CoV2.7” 2° With the data and
evidence provided by the CDC, the usual
incubation period is probably 3 to 7 days,
sometimes being prolonged up to even 2
weeks, and the typical symptom occurrence
