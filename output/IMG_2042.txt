The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in fecal samples
has posed grave public health concerns. In addition
to the direct transmission mainly occurring via
droplets of sneezing and coughing, other routes, such
as fecal excretion and environmental and fomite
contamination, are contributing to SARS-CoV-2
transmission and spread ( ). Fecal excretion
has also been documented for SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV, along with the potential to stay viable
in situations aiding fecal-oral transmission. Thus,
SARS-CoV-2 has every possibility to be transmitted
through this mode. Fecal-oral transmission of SARS-
CoV-2, particularly in regions having low standards
of hygiene and poor sanitation, may have grave
consequences with regard to the high spread of this
virus. Ethanol and disinfectants containing chlorine
or bleach are effective against coronaviruses
( ). Appropriate precautions need to be
followed strictly while handling the stools of patients
infected with SARS-CoV-2. Biowaste materials and
sewage from hospitals must be adequately
disinfected, treated, and disposed of properly. The
