polymorphism at nucleotide position 28,144, which
results in amino acid substitution of Ser for Lys at residue
84 of the ORF8 protein. Those variants with this muta-
tion make up a single subclade labelled as ‘clade S*”*.
Currently, however, the available sequence data are not
sufficient to interpret the early global transmission his-
tory of the virus, and travel patterns, founder effects and
public health measures also strongly influence the spread
of particular lineages, irrespective of potential biological
differences between different virus variants.

Animal host and spillover

Bats are important natural hosts of alphacoronavi-
ruses and betacoronaviruses. The closest relative
to SARS-CoV-2 known to date is a bat coronavirus
detected in Rhinolophus affinis from Yunnan province,
China, named ‘RaTG13’, whose full-length genome
sequence is 96.2% identical to that of SARS-CoV-2
(REF."'). This bat virus shares more than 90% sequence
identity with SARS-CoV-2 in all ORFs throughout
the genome, including the highly variable S and ORF8
(REF.''). Phylogenetic analysis confirms that SARS-CoV-2
closely clusters with RaTG13 (FIG. 2). The high genetic
similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 supports
the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 likely originated from
bats*’. Another related coronavirus has been reported

more recently in a Rhinolophus malayanus bat sampled
in Yunnan Thic navel hat virne denated ‘RmYNN7’
