CoV-2 (329).

Similarly, the National Veterinary Services
Laboratories of the USDA have reported COVID-19
in tigers and lions that exhibited respiratory signs

like dry cough and wheezing. The zoo animals are
suspected to have been infected by an asymptomatic
zookeeper (335). The total number of COVID-19-
positive cases in human beings is increasing at a high
rate, thereby creating ideal conditions for viral
spillover to other species, such as pigs. The evidence
obtained from SARS-CoV suggests that pigs can get
infected with SARS-CoV-2 (336). However,
experimental inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 failed to
infect pigs (329).

Further studies are required to identify the
possible animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 and the
seasonal variation in the circulation of these viruses
in the animal population. Research collaboration
between human and animal health sectors is
becoming a necessity to evaluate and identify the
possible risk factors of transmission between animals
and humans. Such cooperation will help to devise
efficient strategies for the management of emerging

zoonotic diseases (12).
