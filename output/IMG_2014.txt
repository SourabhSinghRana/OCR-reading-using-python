possibility of misinterpretation could arise. However,

in another case study, the authors raised concerns
over the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine-
azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 patients,
since no observable effect was seen when they were
used. In some cases, the treatment was discontinued
due to the prolongation of the QT interval (307).
Hence, further randomized clinical trials are required
before concluding this matter.

Recently, another FDA-approved drug,
ivermectin, was reported to inhibit the in vitro
replication of SARS-CoV-2. The findings from this
study indicate that a single treatment of this drug was
able to induce an ~5,000-fold reduction in the viral
RNA at 48 h in cell culture. (308). One of the main
disadvantages that limit the clinical utility of
ivermectin is its potential to cause cytotoxicity.
However, altering the vehicles used in_ the
formulations, the pharmacokinetic properties can be
modified, thereby having significant control over the
systemic concentration of ivermectin (338). Based
on the pharmacokinetic simulation, it was also found
that ivermectin may have limited therapeutic utility
in managing COVID-19, since the inhibitory

concentration that has to be achieved for effective
anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity is far higher than the
