Initially, the epicenter of the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic was China, which reported a significant
number of deaths associated with COVID-19, with
84,458 laboratory-confirmed cases and 4,644 deaths
as of 13 May 2020 (Fig. 4). As of 13 May 2020,
SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases have been reported in
more than 210 countries apart from China (Fig. 3
and 4) (WHO Situation Report 114) (25, 64).
COVID-19 has been reported on all continents
except Antarctica. For many weeks, Italy was the
focus of concerns regarding the large number of
cases, with 221,216 cases and 30,911 deaths, but
now, the United States is the country with the largest
number of cases, 1,322,054, and 79,634 deaths.

Now, the United Kingdom has even more cases
(226,4671) and deaths (32,692) than Italy. A John
Hopkins University web platform has provided daily

updates on the basic epidemiology of the COVID-19
outbreak
