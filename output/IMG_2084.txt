and other SARSr-CoVs (FIG. 2). Using sequences of five
conserved replicative domains in pp lab (3C-like protease
(3CLpro), nidovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp)-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN),
RdRp, zinc-binding domain (ZBD) and HEL1), the
Coronaviridae Study Group of the International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses estimated the
pairwise patristic distances between SARS-CoV-2 and
known coronaviruses, and assigned SARS-CoV-2 to
the existing species SARSr-CoV”’. Although phyloge-
netically related, SARS-CoV-2 is distinct from all other
coronaviruses from bats and pangolins in this species.
The SARS-CoV-2 S protein has a full size of
1,273 amino acids, longer than that of SARS-CoV
(1,255 amino acids) and known bat SARSr-CoVs
(1,245-1,269 amino acids). It is distinct from the S pro-
teins of most members in the subgenus Sarbecovirus,
sharing amino acid sequence similarities of 76.7-
77.0% with SARS-CoVs from civets and humans,
