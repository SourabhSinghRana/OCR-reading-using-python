Analysis of the initial cluster of infections suggests
that the infected individuals had a common exposure
point, a seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei Province,
China ( ). The restaurants of this market are
well-known for providing different types of wild
animals for human consumption (71). The Huanan
South China Seafood Market also sells live animals,
such as poultry, bats, snakes, and marmots (72). This
might be the point where zoonotic (animal-to-
human) transmission occurred (71). Although
SARS-CoV-2 is alleged to have originated from an
animal host (zoonotic origin) with further human-to-
human transmission ( ), the likelihood of
foodborne transmission should be ruled out with
further investigations, since it is a latent possibility
(1). Additionally, other potential and expected routes
would be associated with transmission, as in other
respiratory viruses, by direct contact, such as shaking
contaminated hands, or by direct contact with
contaminated surfaces ( ). Still, whether blood
transfusion and organ transplantation (276), as well
as transplacental and perinatal routes, are possible
routes for SARS-CoV-2 transmission needs to be

determined ( ).
