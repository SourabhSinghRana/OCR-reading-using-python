strain of Mycobacterium bovis. At present, three new

clinical trials have been registered to evaluate the
protective role of BCG vaccination against SARS-
CoV-2 (363). Recently, a cohort study was conducted
to evaluate the impact of childhood BCG vaccination
in COVID-19 PCR positivity rates. However,
childhood BCG vaccination was found to be
associated with a rate of COVID-19-positive test
results similar to that of the nonvaccinated group
(364). Further studies are required to analyze
whether BCG vaccination in childhood can induce
protective effects against COVID-19 in adulthood.
Population genetic studies conducted on 103
genomes identified that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has
evolved into two major types, L and S. Among the
two types, L type is expected to be the most
prevalent (~70%), followed by the S type (~30%)
(366). This finding has a significant impact on our
race to develop an ideal vaccine, since the vaccine
candidate has to target both strains to be considered
effective. At present, the genetic differences between
the L and S types are very small and may not affect
the immune response. However, we can expect
further genetic variations in the coming days that

could lead to the emergence of new strains (367).
