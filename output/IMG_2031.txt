lower respiratory tracts. Acute viral interstitial pneu-
monia and humoral and cellular immune responses
were observed**”’. Moreover, prolonged virus shedding
peaked early in the course of infection in asymptomatic
macaques’, and old monkeys showed severer intersti-
tial pneumonia than young monkeys’’, which is similar
to what is seen in patients with COVID-19. In human
ACE2-transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, typ-
ical interstitial pneumonia was present, and viral anti-
gens were observed mainly in the bronchial epithelial
cells, macrophages and alveolar epithelia. Some human
ACE2-transgenic mice even died after infection”.
In wide-type mice, a SARS-CoV-2 mouse-adapted strain
with the N501Y alteration in the RBD of the S protein
was generated at passage 6. Interstitial pneumonia and
inflammatory responses were found in both young
and aged mice after infection with the mouse-adapted
strain’*. Golden hamsters also showed typical symptoms
after being infected with SARS-CoV-2 (REF.””). In other
animal models, including cats and ferrets, SARS-CoV-2
could efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract
but did not induce severe clinical symptoms**”*. As trans-
mission by direct contact and air was observed in infected
ferrets and hamsters, these animals could be used to
model different transmission modes of COVID-19
(REFS’-”). Animal models offer important information
for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2
infection and the transmission dynamics of SARS-
CoV-2, and are important to evaluate the efficacy of
antiviral therapeutics and vaccines.

Clinical and epidemiological features

It appears that all ages of the population are susceptible to
SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the median age of infection
is around 50 years”'****°*', However, clinical manifesta-
tions differ with age. In general, older men (>60 years
old) with co-morbidities are more likely to develop
severe respiratory disease that requires hospitalization
