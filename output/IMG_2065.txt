reduce virus-triggered immune pathologies in
COVID-19 (209). The later stages of coronavirus-
induced inflammatory cascades are characterized by

the release of proinflammatory interleukin-1 (IL-1)
family members, such as IL-1 and IL-33. Hence,
there exists a possibility that the inflammation
associated with coronavirus can be inhibited by
utilizing anti-inflammatory cytokines that belong to
the IL-1 family (92). It has also been suggested that
the actin protein is the host factor that is involved in
cell entry and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Hence,
those drugs that modulate the biological activity of
this protein, like ibuprofen, might have some
therapeutic application in managing the disease
(174). The plasma angiotensin 2 level was found to
be markedly elevated in COVID-19 infection and
was correlated with viral load and lung injury.
Hence, drugs that block angiotensin receptors may
have potential for treating COVID-19 infection
(121). A scientist from Germany, named Rolf
Hilgenfeld, has been working on the identification of
drugs for the treatment of coronaviral infection since
the time of the first SARS outbreak (19).

The SARS-CoV S2 subunit has a significant
function in mediating virus fusion that provides entry
into the host cell. Heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and heptad
