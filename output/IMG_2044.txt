respiratory infection (SARI) and respiratory
distress, shock or hypoxaemia. Patients with
SARI can be given conservative fluid therapy
only when there is no evidence of shock.
Empiric antimicrobial therapy must be started
to manage SARI. For patients with sepsis,
antimicrobials must be administered within 1
hour of initial assessments. The WHO and CDC
recommend that glucocorticoids not be used in
patients with COVID-19 pneumonia except
where there are other indications (exacerbation
of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).

Patients’ clinical deterioration is closely
observed with SARI; however, rapidly
progressive respiratory failure and sepsis
require immediate supportive care
interventions comprising quick use of
neuromuscular blockade and sedatives,
hemodynamic management, nutritional
support, maintenance of blood glucose levels,
prompt assessment and treatment of
nosocomial pneumonia, and prophylaxis
against deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and
gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.°’ Generally, such
patients give way to their primary illness to
secondary complications like sepsis or
multiorgan system failure.
