and preventive strategies, including vaccines,

immunotherapeutics, and antiviral drugs, have been
exploited against the previous CoV _ outbreaks
(SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) (8, ; ).
These valuable options have already been evaluated
for their potency, efficacy, and safety, along with
several other types of current research that will fuel
our search for ideal therapeutic agents against
COVID-19 (7, 9, 19, 21, 36). The primary cause of
the unavailability of approved and commercial
vaccines, drugs, and therapeutics to counter the
earlier SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV seems to owe to
the lesser attention of the biomedicine and
pharmaceutical companies, as these two CoVs did
not cause much havoc, global threat, and panic like
those posed by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (19).
Moreover, for such outbreak situations, the
requirement for vaccines and _therapeutics/drugs
exists only for a limited period, until the outbreak is
controlled. The proportion of the human population
infected with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was also
much lower across the globe, failing to attract drug
and vaccine manufacturers and producers. Therefore,
by the time an effective drug or vaccine is designed
against such disease outbreaks, the virus would have

been controlled by adopting appropriate and strict
