6.1 Laboratory testing for
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-
19) in suspected human cases

The assessment of the patients with COVID-19
should be based on the clinical features and
also epidemiological factors. The screening
protocols must be prepared and followed per
the native context.*' Collecting and testing of
specimen samples from the suspected
individual is considered to be one of the main
principles for controlling and managing the
outbreak of the disease in a country. The
suspected cases must be screened thoroughly
in order to detect the virus with the help of
nucleic acid amplification tests such as reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-
PCR). If a country or a particular region does not
have the facility to test the specimens, the
specimens of the suspected individual should
be sent to the nearest reference laboratories
per the list provided by WHO.°7

It is also recommended that the suspected
patients be tested for the other respiratory
pathogens by performing the routine laboratory
investigation per the local guidelines, mainly to
differentiate from other viruses that include
influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus,
respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human
