on surfaces. The virus can remain
viable on surfaces for days in
favourable atmospheric conditions but
are destroyed in less than a minute by
common disinfectants like sodium
hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide etc.
[13]. Infection is acquired either by
inhalation of these droplets or touching
surfaces contaminated by them and
then touching the nose, mouth and
eyes. The virus is also present in the
stool and contamination of the water
supply and subsequent transmission
via aerosolization/feco oral route is
also hypothesized [6]. As per current
information, transplacental
transmission from pregnant women to
their fetus has not been described [14].
However, neonatal disease due to post
natal transmission is described [14].
The incubation period varies from 2 to
14 d [median 5 d]. Studies have
