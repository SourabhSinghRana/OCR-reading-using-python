symptoms were noticed in those patients that are

infected by human-to-human transmission (14).

The initial trends suggested that the mortality
associated with COVID-19 was less than that of
previous outbreaks of SARS (101). The updates
obtained from countries like China, Japan, Thailand,
and South Korea indicated that the COVID-19
patients had relatively mild manifestations compared
to those with SARS and MERS (4). Regardless of
the coronavirus type, immune cells, like mast cells,
that are present in the submucosa of the respiratory
tract and nasal cavity are considered the primary
barrier against this virus (92). Advanced in-depth
analysis of the genome has identified 380 amino acid
substitutions between the amino acid sequences of
SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS/SARS-like
coronaviruses. These differences in the amino acid
sequences might have contributed to the difference
in the pathogenic divergence of SARS-CoV-2 (16).
Further research is required to evaluate the possible
differences in tropism, pathogenesis, and
transmission of this novel agent associated with this
change in the amino acid sequence. With the current
outbreak of COVID-19, there is an expectancy of a
significant increase in the number of published
studies about this emerging coronavirus, as occurred
