was previously found to possess potent antiviral
activity against MERS, Marburg, Ebola, and
Chikungunya viruses (306). Even though it had

broad-spectrum activity, it was neglected for an
extended period. Tilorone is another antiviral drug
that might have activity against SARS-CoV-2.
Remdesivir, a novel nucleotide analog prodrug,
was developed for treating Ebola virus disease
(EVD), and it was also found to inhibit the
replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV_ in
primary human airway epithelial cell culture systems
(195). Recently, in vitro study has proven that
remdesivir has better antiviral activity than lopinavir
and ritonavir. Further, in vivo studies conducted in
mice also identified that treatment with remdesivir
improved pulmonary function and reduced viral
loads and lung pathology both in prophylactic and
therapeutic regimens compared to
lopinavir/ritonavir-IFN-y treatment in MERS-CoV
infection (8). Remdesivir also inhibits a diverse
range of coronaviruses, including circulating human
CoV, zoonotic bat CoV, and prepandemic zoonotic
CoV (195). Remdesivir is also considered the only
therapeutic drug that significantly reduces
pulmonary pathology (8). All these findings indicate

that remdesivir has to be further evaluated for its
