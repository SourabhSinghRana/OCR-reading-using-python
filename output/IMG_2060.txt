; , ; ). Coronavirus infection is linked to

different kinds of clinical manifestations, varying
from enteritis in cows and pigs, upper respiratory
disease in chickens, and fatal respiratory infections
in humans (30).

Among the CoV genera, Alphacoronavirus and
Betacoronavirus infect mammals, while
Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus mainly
infect birds, fishes, and, sometimes, mammals (27,

; ). Several novel coronaviruses that come
under the genus Deltacoronavirus have been
discovered in the past from birds, like Wigeon
coronavirus HKU20, Bulbul coronavirus HKU11,
Munia coronavirus HKU13, white-eye coronavirus
HKU16, night-heron coronavirus HKU19, and
common moorhen coronavirus HKU21, as well as
from pigs (porcine coronavirus HKUI5) (6, 29).
Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine
epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and _ porcine
hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV)
are some of the coronaviruses of swine. Among
them, TGEV and PEDV are responsible for causing
severe gastroenteritis in young piglets with
noteworthy morbidity and mortality. Infection with
PHEV also causes enteric infection but can cause

encephalitis due to its ability to infect the nervous
