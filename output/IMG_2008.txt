Bovine coronaviruses (BoCoVs) are known to

infect several domestic and wild ruminants (126).
BoCoV inflicts neonatal calf diarrhea in adult cattle,
leading to bloody diarrhea (winter dysentery) and
respiratory disease complex (shipping fever) in cattle
of all age groups (126). BoCoV-like viruses have
been noted in humans, suggesting its zoonotic
potential as well (127). Feline enteric and feline
infectious peritonitis (FIP) viruses are the two major
feline CoVs (128), where feline CoVs can affect the
gastrointestinal tract, abdominal cavity (peritonitis),
respiratory tract, and central nervous system (128).
Canines are also affected by CoVs that fall under
different genera, namely, canine enteric coronavirus
in Alphacoronavirus and canine _ respiratory
coronavirus in Betacoronavirus, affecting the enteric
and respiratory tract, respectively (129, ). IBV,
under Gammacoronavirus, causes diseases of
respiratory, urinary, and reproductive systems, with
substantial economic losses in chickens (131, ).
In small laboratory animals, mouse hepatitis virus,
rat sialodacryoadenitis coronavirus, and guinea pig
and rabbit coronaviruses are the major CoVs
associated with disease manifestations like enteritis,
hepatitis, and respiratory infections (10, ).
