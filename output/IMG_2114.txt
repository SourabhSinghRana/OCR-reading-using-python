Based on molecular characterization, SARS-

CoV-2 is considered a new _ Betacoronavirus
belonging to the subgenus Sarbecovirus (3). A few
other critical zoonotic viruses (MERS-related CoV
and SARS-related CoV) belong to the same genus.
However, SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a distinct
virus based on the percent identity with other
Betacoronavirus; conserved open reading frame la/b
(ORF la/b) is below 90% identity (3). An overall
80% nucleotide identity was observed between
SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS-CoV, along
with 89% identity with ZC45 and ZXC21 SARS-
related CoVs of bats (2, 31, 36). In addition, 82%
identity has been observed between SARS-CoV-2
and human SARS-CoV Tor2 and human SARS-CoV
BJO1 2003 (31). A sequence identity of only 51.8%
was observed between MERS-related CoV and the
recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 (37). Phylogenetic
analysis of the structural genes also revealed that
SARS-CoV-2 is closer to bat SARS-related CoV.
Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 might have originated from
bats, while other amplifier hosts might have played a

role in disease transmission to humans (31). Of note,
the other two zoonotic CoVs (MERS-related CoV
and SARS-related CoV) also originated from bats
(38, 39). Nevertheless, for SARS and MERS, civet
