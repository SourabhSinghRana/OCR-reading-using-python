variant group. The receptor-binding gene region
appears to be very similar to that of the SARS-
CoV and it is believed that the same receptor
would be used for cell entry. '7

4.1 Virion structure and its
genome

Coronaviruses are structurally enveloped,
belonging to the positive-strand RNA viruses
category that has the largest known genomes of
RNA. The structures of the coronavirus are
more spherical in shape, but their structure has
the potential to modify their morphology in
response to environmental conditions, being
pleomorphic. The capsular membrane which
represents the outer envelope usually has
glycoprotein projection and covers the nucleus,
comprising a matrix protein containing a
positive-strand RNA. Since the structure
possesses 5'-capped and 3'-polyadenylated
ends, it remains identical to the cellular
mRNAs.'® The structure is comprised of
hemagglutinin esterase (HE) (present only in
some beta-coronaviruses), spike (S), small
membrane (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid
(N), as shown (Figure 1). The envelope
containing glycoprotein is responsible for
attachment to the host cell, which possesses the
primary anti-genic epitopes mainly those
