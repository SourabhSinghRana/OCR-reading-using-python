efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 infection in

humans. The broad-spectrum activity exhibited by
remdesivir will help control the spread of disease in
the event of a new coronavirus outbreak.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug known to
possess antiviral activity due to its ability to block
virus-cell fusion by raising the endosomal pH
necessary for fusion. It also interferes with virus-
receptor binding by interfering with the terminal
glycosylation of SARS-CoV cellular receptors, such
as ACE2 (196). In a recent multicenter clinical trial
that was conducted in China, chloroquine phosphate
was found to exhibit both efficacy and safety in the
therapeutic management of SARS-CoV-2-associated
pneumonia (197). This drug is already included in
the treatment guidelines issued by the National
Health Commission of the People’s Republic of
China. The preliminary clinical trials using
hydroxychloroquine, another aminoquinoline drug,
gave promising results. The COVID-19 patients
received 600 mg of hydroxychloroquine daily along
with azithromycin as a single-arm protocol. This
protocol was found to be associated with a
noteworthy reduction in viral load. Finally, it
resulted in a complete cure (271); however, the study
comprised a small population and, hence, the
