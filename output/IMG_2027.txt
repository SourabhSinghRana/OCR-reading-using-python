and chest discomfort, and in severe cases dyspnea and
bilateral lung infiltration’’. Among the first 27 docu-
mented hospitalized patients, most cases were epidemi-
ologically linked to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.
a wet market located in downtown Wuhan, which sells
not only seafood but also live animals, including poultry
and wildlife**. According to a retrospective study, the
onset of the first known case dates back to 8 Decembet
2019 (REF). On 31 December, Wuhan Municipal Health
Commission notified the public of a pneumonia out-
break of unidentified cause and informed the World
Health Organization (WHO) (FIG. 1).

By metagenomic RNA sequencing and virus isola-
tion from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from
patients with severe pneumonia, independent team:
of Chinese scientists identified that the causative agent o!
this emerging disease is a betacoronavirus that had never
been seen before*’*''. On 9 January 2020, the result ot
this etiological identification was publicly announced
(FIG. i). The first genome sequence of the novel coro-
navirus was published on the Virological website or
10 January, and more nearly complete genome sequences
determined by different research institutes were then
released via the GISAID database on 12 January’
Later, more patients with no history of exposure tc
Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market were identified.
Several familial clusters of infection were reported.
and nosocomial infection also occurred in health-care
facilities. All these cases provided clear evidence fo1
human-to-human transmission of the new virus*’*-'*
As the outbreak coincided with the approach of the
lunar New Year, travel between cities before the festiva.
facilitated virus transmission in China. This novel coro-
navirus pneumonia soon spread to other cities in Hube’
province and to other parts of China. Within 1 month.
