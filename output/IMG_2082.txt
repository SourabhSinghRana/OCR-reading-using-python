of plasma cytokines, which suggests an immunopatho-
logical process caused by a cytokine storm”*®*”. In this
cohort of patient, around 2.3% people died within
a median time of 16 days from disease onset”**. Men
older than 68 years had a higher risk of respiratory fail-
ure, acute cardiac injury and heart failure that led to
death, regardless of a history of cardiovascular disease*°

from hospital in 2 weeks”*? (FIG. 4).

Early transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan in
December 2019 was initially linked to the Huanan
Seafood Wholesale Market, and it was suggested as
the source of the outbreak”’*”. However, community
transmission might have happened before that**. Later,
ongoing human-to-human transmission propagated the
outbreak’. It is generally accepted that SARS-CoV-2 is
more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV;
however, determination of an accurate reproduction
number (RO) for COVID-19 is not possible yet, as many
asymptomatic infections cannot be accurately accounted
for at this stage®’. An estimated RO of 2.5 (ranging from
1.8 to 3.6) has been proposed for SARS-CoV-2 recently,
compared with 2.0-3.0 for SARS-CoV”. Notably, most
of the SARS-CoV-2 human-to-human transmission
early in China occurred in family clusters, and in other
countries large outbreaks also happened in other set-
tings, such as migrant worker communities, slaughter-
houses and meat packing plants, indicating the necessity
of isolating infected people”'*”'~”’. Nosocomial transmis-
sion was not the main source of transmission in China

because of the implementation of infection control
measures in clinical settings’. By contrast, a high risk
of nosocomial transmission was reported in some other
