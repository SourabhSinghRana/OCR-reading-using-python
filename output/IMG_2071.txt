progress from the initial focal unilateral to diffuse

bilateral ground-glass opacities and will further
progress to or coexist with lung consolidation
changes within 1 to 3 weeks (159). The role played
by radiologists in the current scenario is very
important. Radiologists can help in the early
diagnosis of lung abnormalities associated with
COVID-19 pneumonia. They can also help in the
evaluation of disease severity, identifying its
progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome
and the presence of secondary bacterial infections
(160). Even though chest CT is considered an
essential diagnostic tool for COVID-19, the
extensive use of CT for screening purposes in the
suspected individuals might be associated with a
disproportionate risk-benefit ratio due to increased
radiation exposure as well as increased risk of cross-
infection. Hence, the use of CT for early diagnosis of
SARS-CoV-2 infection in high-risk groups should be
done with great caution (292).

More recently, other advanced diagnostics have

been designed and developed for the detection of
SARS-CoV-2 (345, : ). A reverse
transcriptional loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (RT-LAMP), namely, iLACO, has been
developed for rapid and colorimetric detection of this
