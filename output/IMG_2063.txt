However, the success of such a vaccine relies greatly

on its ability to provide protection not only against
present versions of the virus but also the ones that
are likely to emerge in the future. This can be
achieved by identifying antibodies that can recognize
relatively conserved epitopes that are maintained as
such even after the occurrence of considerable
variations (362). Even though several vaccine
clinical trials are being conducted around the world,
pregnant women have been completely excluded
from these studies. Pregnant women are highly
vulnerable to emerging diseases such as COVID-19
due to alterations in the immune system and other
physiological systems that are associated with
pregnancy. Therefore, in the event of successful
vaccine development, pregnant women will not get
access to the vaccines (361). Hence, it is
recommended that pregnant women be included in
the ongoing vaccine trials, since successful
vaccination in pregnancy will protect the mother,
fetus, and newborn.

The heterologous immune effects induced by
Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG) vaccination is a
promising strategy for controlling the COVID-19
pandemic and requires further investigations. BCG is

a widely used vaccine against tuberculosis in high-
