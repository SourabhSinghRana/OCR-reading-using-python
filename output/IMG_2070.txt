links associated with SARS-CoV-2, the One Health
approach may play a vital role in the prevention and

control measures being followed to restrain this
pandemic virus ( ). The — substantial
importation of COVID-19 presymptomatic cases
from Wuhan has resulted in independent, self-
sustaining outbreaks across major cities both within
the country and across the globe. The majority of
Chinese cities are now facing localized outbreaks of
COVID-19 (231). Hence, deploying efficient public
health interventions might help to cut the spread of
this virus globally.

The occurrence of COVID-19 infection on
several cruise ships gave us a preliminary idea
regarding the transmission pattern of the disease.
Cruise ships act as a closed environment and provide
an ideal setting for the occurrence of respiratory
disease outbreaks. Such a situation poses a
significant threat to travelers, since people from
different countries are on board, which favors the
introduction of the pathogen (320). Although nearly
30 cruise ships from different countries have been
found harboring COVID-19 infection, the major
