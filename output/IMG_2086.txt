primary anti-genic epitopes mainly those
recognised by neutralising antibodies. The spike
S-protein being in a spike form is subjected to a
structural rearrangement process so that fusing
the outer membrane of the virus with the host-
cell membrane becomes easier.'? 2° Recent
SARS-CoV work has also shown that the
membrane exopeptidase ACE enzyme
(angiotensin-converting enzyme) functions as a
COVID-19 receptor to enter the human cell.*'
