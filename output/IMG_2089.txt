Repurposed drugs have been studied for treating
CoV infections, like lopinavir/ritonavir, and
interferon-1f8 revealed in vitro anti-MERS-CoV
action. The in vivo experiment carried out in the
nonhuman primate model of common marmosets
treated with lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta
showed superior protective results in treated animals
than in the untreated ones (190). A combination of
these drugs is being evaluated to treat MERS in
humans (MIRACLE trial) (191). These two protease
inhibitors (lopinavir and ritonavir), in combination
with ribavirin, gave encouraging clinical outcomes in
SARS patients, suggesting their therapeutic values
(165). However, in the current scenario, due to the
lack of specific therapeutic agents against SARS-
CoV-2, hospitalized patients confirmed for the
disease are given supportive care, like oxygen and
fluid therapy, along with antibiotic therapy for
managing secondary bacterial infections (192).
