virulence of coronaviruses due to changes in

morphology and tropism (54). The E protein consists
of three domains, namely, a short hydrophilic amino
terminal, a large hydrophobic transmembrane
domain, and an efficient C-terminal domain (51).
The SARS-CoV-2 E protein reveals a similar amino
acid constitution without any substitution (16).

N Protein

The N protein of coronavirus is multipurpose.
Among several functions, it plays a role in complex
formation with the viral genome, facilitates M
protein interaction needed during virion assembly,
and enhances the transcription efficiency of the virus
(55, 56). It contains three highly conserved and
distinct domains, namely, an NTD, an RNA-binding
domain or a linker region (LKR), and a CTD (57).
The NTD binds with the 3’ end of the viral genome,
perhaps via electrostatic interactions, and is highly
diverged both in length and sequence (58). The
charged LKR is serine and arginine rich and is also
known as the SR (serine and arginine) domain (59).
The LKR is capable of direct interaction with in vitro
RNA interaction and is responsible for cell signaling
(60, 61). It also modulates the antiviral response of

the host by working as an antagonist for interferon
