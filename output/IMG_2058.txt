observations indicated that the monkeys with

reexposure had no recurrence of COVID-19, like the
SARS-CoV-2-infected monkeys without rechallenge.
These findings suggest that primary infection with
SARS-CoV-2 could protect from later exposures to
the virus, which could help in defining disease
prognosis and crucial inferences for designing and
developing potent vaccines against COVID-19
(274).

PREVENTION, CONTROL, AND

MANAGEMENT

In contrast to their response to the 2002 SARS
outbreak, China has shown immense political
openness in reporting the COVID-19 outbreak
promptly. They have also performed rapid
sequencing of COVID-19 at multiple levels and
shared the findings globally within days of
identifying the novel virus (225). The move made by
China opened a new chapter in global health security
and diplomacy. Even though complete lockdown was
declared following the COVID-19 outbreak in

surrounding provinces as well as to several other

countries. Large-scale screening programs might
