that it works only when the test subject has an active

infection, limiting its use to the earlier stages of
infection. Several laboratories around the world are
currently developing antibody-based diagnostic tests
against SARS-CoV-2 (157).

Chest CT is an ideal diagnostic tool for
identifying viral pneumonia. The sensitivity of chest
CT is far superior to that of X-ray screening. The
chest CT findings associated with COVID-19-
infected patients include characteristic patchy
infiltration that later progresses to ground-glass
opacities (158). Early manifestations of COVID-19
pneumonia might not be evident in X-ray chest
radiography. In such situations, a chest CT
examination can be performed, as it is considered
highly specific for COVID-19 pneumonia (118).
Those patients having COVID-19 pneumonia will
exhibit the typical ground-glass opacity in their chest
CT images (154). The patients infected with
COVID-19 had elevated plasma angiotensin 2 levels.
The level of angiotensin 2 was found to be linearly
associated with viral load and lung injury, indicating
its potential as a diagnostic biomarker (121). The
chest CT imaging abnormalities associated with
COVID-19 pneumonia have also been observed even

in asymptomatic patients. These abnormalities
