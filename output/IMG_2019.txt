in Yunnan. This novel bat virus, denoted ‘RmYN02’,
is 93.3% identical to SARS-CoV-2 across the genome.
In the long Jab gene, it exhibits 97.2% identity to
SARS-CoV-2, which is even higher than for RaTG13
(REF.*). In addition to RaTG13 and RmYNO02, phyloge-
netic analysis shows that bat coronaviruses ZC45 and
ZXC21 previously detected in Rhinolophus pusillus
bats from eastern China also fall into the SARS-CoV-2
lineage of the subgenus Sarbecovirus” (FIG. 2). The dis-
covery of diverse bat coronaviruses closely related to
SARS-CoV-2 suggests that bats are possible reservoirs
of SARS-CoV-2 (REF.”). Nevertheless, on the basis of
current findings, the divergence between SARS-CoV-2
and related bat coronaviruses likely represents more than
20 years of sequence evolution, suggesting that these bat
coronaviruses can be regarded only as the likely evolu-
tionary precursor of SARS-CoV-2 but not as the direct
progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 (REF.*).

Beyond bats, pangolins are another wildlife host
probably linked with SARS-CoV-2. Multiple SARS-CoV-2-
related viruses have been identified in tissues of Malayan
pangolins smuggled from Southeast Asia into southern
China from 2017 to 2019. These viruses from pangolins
independently seized by Guangxi and Guangdong pro-
vincial customs belong to two distinct sublineages*”’.
The Guangdong strains, which were isolated or
sequenced by different research groups from smug-
gled pangolins, have 99.8% sequence identity with each
other*'. They are very closely related to SARS-CoV-2,
exhibiting 92.4% sequence similarity. Notably, the RBD
of Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses is highly similar
to that of SARS-CoV-2. The receptor-binding motif
(RBM; which is part of the RBD) of these viruses has
only one amino acid variation from SARS-CoV-2, and
it is identical to that of SARS-CoV-2 in all five critical
