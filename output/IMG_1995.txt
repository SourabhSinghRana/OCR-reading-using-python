been used based on the experience
with SARS and MERS. In a historical
control study in patients with SARS,
patients treated with lopinavir-
ritonavir with ribavirin had better
outcomes as compared to those given

ribavirin alone [15].

In the case series of 99 hospitalized
patients with COVID-19 infection from
Wuhan, oxygen was given to 76%, non-
invasive ventilation in 13%,
mechanical ventilation in 4%,
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
(ECMO) in 3%, continuous renal
replacement therapy (CRRT) in 9%,
antibiotics in 71%, antifungals in 15%,
glucocorticoids in 19% and intravenous
immunoglobulin therapy in 27% [15].
Antiviral therapy consisting of
oseltamivir, ganciclovir and lopinavir-
ritonavir was given to 75% of the

patients. The duration of non-invasive

ventilation was 4-22 d [median 9 d]
