to evaluate the risk of future epidemics. Presently,

licensed antiviral drugs or vaccines against SARS-
CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are lacking.
However, advances in designing antiviral drugs and
vaccines against several other emerging diseases will
help develop suitable therapeutic agents against
COVID-19 in a short time. Until then, we must rely
exclusively on various control and prevention
measures to prevent this new disease from becoming
a pandemic.
