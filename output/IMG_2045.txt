To assess the genetic variation of different SARS-
CoV-2 strains, the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource
of China National Center for Bioinformation aligned
77,801 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 detected glob-
ally and identified a total of 15,018 mutations, including
14,824 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (BIGD)”.
In the S protein, four amino acid alterations, V483A,
L455I, F456V and G476S, are located near the binding
interface in the RBD, but their effects on binding to the
host receptor are unknown. The alteration D614G in
the S1 subunit was found far more frequently than other
S variant sites, and it is the marker ofa major subclade of
SARS-CoV-2 (clade G). Since March 2020, SARS-CoV-2
variants with G614 in the S protein have replaced the
original D614 variants and become the dominant form
circulating globally. Compared with the D614 variant,
higher viral loads were found in patients infected with
the G614 variant, but clinical data suggested no signif-
icant link between the D614G alteration and disease
severity’. Pseudotyped viruses carrying the S protein
with G614 generated higher infectious titres than viruses
carrying the S protein with D614, suggesting the altera-
tion may have increased the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2
(REF.**). However, the results of in vitro experiments based
on pseudovirus models may not exactly reflect natural
infection. This preliminary finding should be validated
by more studies using wild-type SARS-CoV-2 variants to
infect different target cells and animal models. Whether
this amino acid change enhanced virus transmissibil-
ity is also to be determined. Another marker mutation
for SARS-CoV-2 evolution is the single-nucleotide
