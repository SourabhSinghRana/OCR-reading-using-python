Inhibition of virus replication. Replication inhibitors
include remdesivir (GS-5734), favilavir (T-705), riba-
virin, lopinavir and ritonavir. Except for lopinavir and
ritonavir, which inhibit 3CLpro, the other three all target
RdRp'**"* (FIG. 5). Remdesivir has shown activity against
SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo'*'”*. A clinical study
revealed a lower need for oxygen support in patients
with COVID-19 (REF.'*’). Preliminary results of the
Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT) clinical
trial by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases (NIAID) reported that remdesivir can shorten
the recovery time in hospitalized adults with COVID-19
by a couple days compared with placebo, but the differ-
ence in mortality was not statistically significant'**. The
FDA has issued an emergency use authorization for rem-
desivir for the treatment of hospitalized patients with
severe COVID-19. It is also the first approved option by
the European Union for treatment of adults and adoles-
cents with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen.
Several international phase III clinical trials are contin-
uing to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir for
the treatment of COVID-19.

Favilavir (T-705), which is an antiviral drug devel-
oped in Japan to treat influenza, has been approved in
China, Russia and India for the treatment of COVID-19.
A clinical study in China showed that favilavir signif-
icantly reduced the signs of improved disease signs
on chest imaging and shortened the time to viral
clearance’. A preliminary report in Japan showed rates
of clinical improvement of 73.8% and 87.8% from the
start of favilavir therapy in patients with mild COVID-19
at 7 and 14 days, respectively, and 40.1% and 60.3%
in patients with severe COVID-19 at 7 and 14 days,
