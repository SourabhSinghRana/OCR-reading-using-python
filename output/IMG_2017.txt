or even die, whereas most young people and children
have only mild diseases (non-pneumonia or mild
pneumonia) or are asymptomatic’*'**. Notably, the risk
of disease was not higher for pregnant women. However,
evidence of transplacental transmission of SARS-CoV-2
from an infected mother to a neonate was reported,
although it was an isolated case*’**. On infection, the
most common symptoms are fever, fatigue and dry
cough'*°*°*!, Less common symptoms include sputum
production, headache, haemoptysis, diarrhoea, anorexia,
sore throat, chest pain, chills and nausea and vomiting in
studies of patients in China'*°**', Self-reported olfac-
tory and taste disorders were also reported by patients
in Italy”. Most people showed signs of diseases after an
incubation period of 1-14 days (most commonly around
5 days), and dyspnoea and pneumonia developed within
a median time of 8 days from illness onset’.

In a report of 72,314 cases in China, 81% of the
cases were classified as mild, 14% were severe cases that
required ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU) and
a 5% were critical (that is, the patients had respiratory
failure, septic shock and/or multiple organ dysfunction
or failure)”*’. On admission, ground-glass opacity was
the most common radiologic finding on chest computed
tomography (CT)'*****'. Most patients also developed
marked lymphopenia, similar to what was observed in
patients with SARS and MERS, and non-survivors devel-
oped severer lymphopenia over time’**”**'. Compared
with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher levels
