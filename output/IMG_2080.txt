severe illness, to minimise the risk of exposure
to COVID-19 during outbreaks.

The strange coronavirus outbreak in the
Chinese city of Wuhan, now termed COVID-19,
and its rapid transmission, threatens people
around the world. Because of its pandemic
nature, the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
and pharmaceutical companies are involved in
the development of COVID-19 vaccines. Xu
Nanping, China’s vice-minister of science and
technology, announced that the first vaccine is
expected to be ready for clinical trials in China
at the end of April 2020.°* There is no approved
vaccine and treatment for COVID-19 infections.

Vaccine development is sponsored and
supported by the Biomedical Advanced
Research and Development Authority (BARDA),
a component of the Office of the Assistant
Secretary for Preparedness and Response
(ASPR). Sanofi will use its egg-free, recombinant
DNA technology to produce an exact genetic
match to proteins of the virus.
