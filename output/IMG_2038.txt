In the unrooted phylogenetic tree of different

betacoronaviruses based on the S protein, virus
sequences from different subgenera grouped into
separate clusters. SARS-CoV-2 sequences from
Wuhan and other countries exhibited a close
relationship and appeared in a single cluster ( ).
The CoVs from the subgenus Sarbecovirus appeared
jointly in SplitsTree and divided into three
subclusters, namely, SARS-CoV-2, bat-SARS-like-
CoV (bat-SL-CoV), and SARS-CoV ( ). In the
case of other subgenera, like Merbecovirus, all of the
sequences grouped in a single cluster, whereas in
Embecovirus, different species, comprised of canine
respiratory CoVs, bovine CoVs, equine CoVs, and
human CoV strain (OC43), grouped in a common
cluster. Isolates in the subgenera Nobecovorus and
Hibecovirus were found to be placed separately
away from other reported SARS-CoVs but shared a
bat origin.
