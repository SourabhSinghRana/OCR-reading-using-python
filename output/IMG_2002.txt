Prevention [21, 30]

Since at this time there are no
approved treatments for this infection,
prevention is crucial. Several
properties of this virus make
prevention difficult namely, non-
specific features of the disease, the
infectivity even before onset of
symptoms in the incubation period,
transmission from asymptomatic
people, long incubation period, tropism
for mucosal surfaces such as the
conjunctiva, prolonged duration of the
illness and transmission even after

clinical recovery.

Isolation of confirmed or suspected
cases with mild illness at home is
recommended. The ventilation at home
should be good with sunlight to allow
for destruction of virus. Patients should
be asked to wear a simple surgical

mask and practice cough hygiene.
