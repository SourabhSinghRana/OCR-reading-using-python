with COVID-19 showed typical features on initial CT,
including bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities
with a peripheral or posterior distribution''*''Т. Thus,
it has been suggested that CT scanning combined
with repeated swab tests should be used for individu-
als with high clinical suspicion of COVID-19 but who
test negative in initial nucleic acid screening''*. Finally,
SARS-CoV-2 serological tests detecting antibodies to
N or S protein could complement molecular diagnosis,
particularly in late phases after disease onset or for retro-
spective studies'То'*Ф'*', However, the extent and dura-
tion of immune responses are still unclear, and available
serological tests differ in their sensitivity and specific-
ity, all of which need to be taken into account when
one is deciding on serological tests and interpreting
their results or potentially in the future test for T cell
responses.

Therapeutics

To date, there are no generally proven effective thera-
pies for COVID-19 or antivirals against SARS-CoV-2,
although some treatments have shown some benefits
in certain subpopulations of patients or for certain end
points (see later). Researchers and manufacturers are
conducting large-scale clinical trials to evaluate var-
ious therapies for COVID-19. As of 2 October 2020,
there were about 405 therapeutic drugs in development
for COVID-19, and nearly 318 in human clinical trials
(COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutics tracker). In the
following sections, we summarize potential therapeutics
against SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of published clinical
data and experience.
