CLINICAL PATHOLOGY OF SARS-CoV-2

(COVID-19)

The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is also
named severe specific contagious pneumonia
(SSCP), Wuhan pneumonia, and, recently, COVID-
19 (110). Compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2
has less severe pathogenesis but has superior
transmission capability, as evidenced by the rapidly
increasing number of COVID-19 cases (111). The
incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 in familial
clusters was found to be 3 to 6 days (112). The mean
incubation period of COVID-19 was found to be 6.4
days, ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (113). Among an
early affected group of 425 patients, 59 years was the
median age, of which more males were affected
(114). Similar to SARS and MERS, the severity of
this nCoV is high in age groups above 50 years (2,

). Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough,
myalgia or fatigue, and, less commonly, headache,

hemoptysis, and diarrhea (116, ). Compared to
the SARS-CoV-2-infected patients in Wuhan during
