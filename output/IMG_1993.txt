other clinical trials in different phases are still ongoing
elsewhere.

Immunomodulatory agents. SARS-CoV-2 triggers a
strong immune response which may cause cytokine
storm syndrome™*'. Thus, immunomodulatory agents
that inhibit the excessive inflammatory response may
be a potential adjunctive therapy for COVID-19.
Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid often used in a wide
range of conditions to relieve inflammation through
its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects.
Recently, the RECOVERY trial found dexamethasone
reduced mortality by about one third in hospitalized
patients with COVID-19 who received invasive mechan-
ical ventilation and by one fifth in patients receiving
oxygen. By contrast, no benefit was found in patients
without respiratory support'*’.

Tocilizumab and sarilumab, two types of interleukin-6
(IL-6) receptor-specific antibodies previously used to
treat various types of arthritis, including rheumatoid
arthritis, and cytokine release syndrome, showed effec-
tiveness in the treatment of severe COVID-19 by atten-
uating the cytokine storm in a small uncontrolled trial'”’.
Bevacizumab is an anti-vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) medication that could potentially reduce
pulmonary oedema in patients with severe COVID-19.
Eculizumab is a specific monoclonal antibody that
inhibits the proinflammatory complement protein C5.
Preliminary results showed that it induced a drop of
inflammatory markers and C-reactive protein levels,
suggesting its potential to be an option for the treatment
of severe COVID- 19 (REF.'“).
