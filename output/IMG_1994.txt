COVID-19 was found to be 3.28, which is
significantly higher than the initial WHO estimate of
1.4 to 2.5 (77). It is too early to obtain the exact Rg
value, since there is a possibility of bias due to

insufficient data. The higher Ro value is indicative of
the more significant potential of SARS-CoV-2
transmission in a susceptible population. This is not
the first time where the culinary practices of China
have been blamed for the origin of novel coronavirus
infection in humans. Previously, the animals present
in the live-animal market were identified to be the
intermediate hosts of the SARS outbreak in China
(78). Several wildlife species were found to harbor
potentially evolving coronavirus strains that can
overcome the species barrier (79). One of the main
principles of Chinese food culture is that live-
slaughtered animals are considered more nutritious
(5).

After 4 months of struggle that lasted from
December 2019 to March 2020, the COVID-19
situation now seems under control in China. The wet
animal markets have reopened, and people have
started buying bats, dogs, cats, birds, scorpions,
badgers, rabbits, pangolins (scaly anteaters), minks,
soup from palm civet, ostriches, hamsters, snapping

turtles, ducks, fish, Siamese crocodiles, and other
