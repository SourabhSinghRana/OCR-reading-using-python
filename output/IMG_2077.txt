with this infection (24).

SARS is a viral respiratory disease caused by a
formerly unrecognized animal CoV that originated
from the wet markets in southern China after
adapting to the human host, thereby enabling
transmission between humans (90). The SARS
outbreak reported in 2002 to 2003 had 8,098
confirmed cases with 774 total deaths (9.6%) (93).
The outbreak severely affected the Asia Pacific
region, especially mainland China (94). Even though
the case fatality rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2
(COVID-19) is lower than that of SARS-CoV, there
exists a severe concern linked to this outbreak due to
its epidemiological similarity to influenza viruses
(95, ). This can fail the public health system,
resulting in a pandemic (96).

MERS is another respiratory disease that was
first reported in Saudi Arabia during the year 2012.
The disease was found to have a CFR of around 35%
(97). The analysis of available data sets suggests that
the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV,
and MERS-CoV is in almost the same range. The
longest predicted incubation time of SARS-CoV-2 is
14 days. Hence, suspected individuals are isolated
for 14 days to avoid the risk of further spread (98).
