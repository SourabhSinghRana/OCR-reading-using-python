Epidemiology and Pathogenesis
(10, 11]

All ages are susceptible. Infection is
transmitted through large droplets
generated during coughing and
sneezing by symptomatic patients but
can also occur from asymptomatic
people and before onset of symptoms
[9]. Studies have shown higher viral
loads in the nasal cavity as compared
to the throat with no difference in viral
burden between symptomatic and
asymptomatic people [12]. Patients can
be infectious for as long as the
symptoms last and even on clinical
recovery. Some people may act as
super spreaders; a UK citizen who
attended a conference in Singapore
infected 11 other people while staying
in a resort in the French Alps and upon
return to the UK [6]. These infected

droplets can spread 1-2 m and deposit
